# 🕹️ RPG Portfolio World (In Progress)

An interactive **2D RPG-style portfolio website** built with **React + Pixi.js**, where users explore a town-like world and discover projects through in-game interactions.

Instead of scrolling through a traditional portfolio, visitors walk through a pixel-art world, interact with landmarks, and open project modals directly inside the game environment.

> 🚧 **This project is currently in active development.**
> Core gameplay and interaction systems are in place, and new features, polish, and content are being added continuously.
